### Background

I am a trained PhD researcher with a background in quantitative methods, qualitative methods, and computational methods. My area of focus is environmental sustainability, especially the beliefs and values that underlie (un)sustainable behavior. My scholarship begins with the premise that working towards a more just and sustainable world is not only a political and technical challenge, but is also a challenge of identity. It is about who we are, both indivdually and collectively.

This is a published, peer-reviewed social science study that uses mixed methods (primarily quantitative) to query whether higher education can foster connectedness to nature. Connectedness to nature is the perception of being part of, rather than separate from, the natural world.

## Project Description

This study examines a large (300-student) introductory college-level ecology course for non majors, "BiSci 3." Fostering connectedness and a fuller relationship with nature is one of the primary goals of BiSci 3, which features reflective assignments, peer-led discussions, and interactive activities. Using pre-and post-test measurements of Nature Relatedness and supplemental interviews, the study addresses the question of whether BiSci 3 can increase learners’ connectedness to nature, both independently and in comparison to similar courses.

The results show that BiSci 3 significantly increased participants’ connectedness, particularly their identification with nature and nature-focused worldview. Other environmental courses studied demonstrated no such changes, suggesting that environmental education does not automatically lead to connectedness; the key difference is likely an intentional focus on connectedness in the goals and approach of the course or program.

If woven into the goals and approach of teaching, connectedness to nature can indeed be fostered in higher education. This is an informative result for environmental scholars and educators, as well as an inspiring one. The path to a sustainable future is long and difficult; environmental education that fosters connectedness to nature can aid us on this journey.
