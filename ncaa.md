### Skills
- Programming (Java, Python)
- Data analysis (Pandas)
- Communication and storytelling

Yes, storytelling. Humans make meaning out of stories, which is true whether the stories are told through TV shows, books, or data science reports. This page tells the story of my NCAA March Madness Pool Optimizer, its creation from the luckiest NCAA postseason imaginable, its lurching evolution, and its recent existential crisis.

This story is way (way) more elaborate and embellished than it needs to be, but I wanted to have fun with it and provide a glimpse into what I'm like as a person and how I communicate. (For another example of my communication style, see my [COVID-19 Communication](covid) page.)

### Background

I don't know anything about NCAA college basketball. I don't watch it, I don't follow it, I don't pay any attention at all to it... except in March, when the annual NCAA tournament rolls around. And when the March Madness tournament rolls around, so, too, do the plethora of casual "office" pools, where a bunch of chumps like me compete with each other to see who can put together the most accurate bracket of predicted winning teams.

*Aside: I actually did know something about NCAA college basketball once. When I was in college, I played on the practice squad for the Colorado State women's basketball team for two years, running opponents' plays and participating in drills and scrimmages. I followed the team fanatically and absorbed a lot of firsthand knowledge about other teams. And you're damn right I won the women's tournament pool by a landslide my first year. No one has joined a women's tournament pool with me since.*

Other than that flash of knowledge from playing on the women's basketball practice squad, I genuinely have not followed, and do not follow, NCAA college basketball at all. The question: How do you put together an optimal NCAA March Madness bracket while knowing nothing about college basketball?

The answer: Scrape some data and write a program, of course.

## Project Description

This project didn't actually start as a NCAA March Madness bracket optimizer. It started because I happened to do extraordinarily well one year in my regular men's tournament pool (which typically has about 60 entries). After the first weekend of games, I was in first place in the pool, which I thought was such an accomplishment that I took a screenshot, drew a big red circle in MS Paint, and sent it to anyone who cared (which was almost certainly less than or equal to one person):
