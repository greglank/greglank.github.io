### Skills
- Visualization (Tableau)
- Relational databases (MySQL)
- Programming (Python)

### Background

This project builds on my [Poker Hand History Parser and Database](parser). The parser reads PokerNow hand histories into a SQLite database, and the resulting database can be used as the basis for additional projects, such as visuzalization. Visuzalization is a handy tool to both summarize what happened in the past (e.g., who won or lost over time) and provide key metrics to inform future-decision making.

## Project Description

I created a public Tableau workbook that visualizes key summary statistics from my online poker group's games of no limit Texas hold 'em.
