# Poker AI and Machine Learning Insights

## Overview

Works in progress that leverage machine learning and AI to derive advanced insights about poker strategy

### Skills
- Machine learning (scikit-learn)
- Deep learning (Keras/TensorFlow)
- Data analysis (Pandas, NumPy)
- Programming (Python)

### Background

This project builds on my [Poker Hand History Parser and Database](parser). I am currently working on a set of projects that use machine learning and deep learning (neural networks) to analyze and improve my own poker play, and possibly my opponents'.

### Limitations

Ethically, since I play poker almost exclusively against friends, I want to take steps to ensure that I don't build an unfair advantage for myself with AI-driven insights. One of the best ways I can level the playing field is to create a complete poker-playing bot (in a simulated poker-playing environment) that plays exactly like me, and allow my friends to play against this Greg-bot as much as they'd like to practice their real-life strategies against me. This is like handing all of my opponents cheat codes to beating me, specifically!

Any AI-driven insights about other players cannot be nearly this thorough, simply because of the asymmetry of available data. I can only build this sort of bot to mimic my own play because I have access to my private hole cards for every hand I've played, whereas the hand histories don't show other players' private hole cards except in specific circumstances, such after winning at showdown or choosing to show their cards voluntarily. Other players' hole card data will always be incomplete, and incomplete in a way that is inevitably biased towards certain kinds of hands. For example, weak hands that are folded (by far the most frequent action in Texas hold 'em) are rarely shown, and thus bias the data set, no matter how many years of data I have for an opponent.

## Project Description

Work in progress... Will be updated as the projects mature!
